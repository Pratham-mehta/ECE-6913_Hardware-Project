We have broken down this project into 3 labs. It is as follows:

## Lab 1 : Microprocessor Operation

The objectives of this lab was to:
- create a PlatformIO project and write, assemble and debug the code.
- Observe and document the operation of microprocessor core as it executes code.

## Lab 2 : General Purpose Inputs and Outputs

The objectives of this lab was to:
- Configure MCU internal peripherals
- Operate the GPIO pins

## Lab 3 : Annunciator (GPIO application)

The objectives of this lab was to:
- make real world application to implement **annunciator** system.<br><br>

This annunciator will generate 3 outputs from the system as shown in the diagram below:<br><br>
